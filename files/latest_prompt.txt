    标题: 40万枚<b>BTC</b>大撤离！加密市场开始寻底之路！ - Binance
真实链接: https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31915115754609
正文: In the past month, long-term Bitcoin holders have unprecedentedly sold
approximately 400,000 BTC, worth over $40 billion, becoming the core driving
force behind this round of market deep correction.

Under the dual pressure of continued tightening of macro liquidity and
concentrated selling by giant whales at the micro level, the cryptocurrency
market is undergoing a severe test. This article will deeply analyze the truth
behind this wave of selling, interpret the macro and micro motivations behind
it, and draw on historical cycle patterns to attempt to explore the bottom
signal of this round of market decline.

The Truth Behind the Giant Whales: The Sale of 400,000 BTC**

When the market is still speculating on the reasons for the decline, on-chain
data has already pointed the direction: this time it is not a panic sell-off
by retail investors, but a collective action by long-term holders.

**1\. The scale of sell-off revealed by the data**

According to data released by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn,

● In the past 30 days, the Bitcoin holdings of long-term holders (LTH) have
net decreased by 405,000 coins. Based on the average price during this period,
the total value of the sold Bitcoin exceeds $40 billion.

● This is not an isolated event. As early as the beginning of September 2025,
this group had begun to reduce their positions, with a net reduction of up to
241,000 BTC in a single week.

● Research institution 10x Research further points out that in the past year,
early holders have cumulatively sold about 500,000 BTC.

**2\. Who are the 'long-term holders'?**

In the field of on-chain analysis, 'long-term holders' are clearly defined as
addresses that have held Bitcoin for more than 155 days. They are the most
steadfast group in the market and are often seen as the 'ballast' of the
market. When this group begins large-scale collective action, it often
indicates that a significant trend reversal may occur.

The New and Old Transition of Capital**

Blockchain analyst @EmberCN pointed out on the X platform: 'This is more like
a transition of new and old capital rather than a panic exit.' Early low-cost
holders, after experiencing significant gains, chose to take profits and lock
in gains. Their selling chips are being absorbed by newly entering
institutional funds (mainly through Bitcoin spot ETFs).

**4\. Specific Whale Cases Surface**

In addition to the collective actions of long-term holders, the movements of
individual 'ancient whales' have had a huge impact on market sentiment.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/pgc/202511/b195a60a66a37e229bc323e124b5f111.png)

● The most typical case is that a whale holding Bitcoin for over 14 years,
with the assistance of Galaxy Digital, sold 80,000 BTC in one go at the end of
July 2025. This transaction was partially completed through exchanges and
partially through over-the-counter trading.

According to informed sources, this sell-off is part of the client's
'inheritance strategy' aimed at avoiding high estate taxes in the U.S. The
disclosure of this news has raised concerns in the market about the full exit
of long-standing holders.

**Two. Reasons for the Decline: Dual Pressures of Macro and Micro**

The current market decline is the result of both the macro environment and
internal market structure at work, forming a typical 'Davis Double Kill'.

**1\. Macroeconomic Background: The tide of liquidity is receding**

● The pivot of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is a core factor. In
response to persistent high inflation, the Federal Reserve has shifted from
'pausing interest rate hikes' in early 2025 to 'discussing interest rate
hikes' and continues to implement quantitative tightening. This directly
drains liquidity from global capital markets, with risk assets being the first
to bear the brunt.

● 'Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been swimming naked.'
This famous quote from Warren Buffett aptly describes the current market
environment. The U.S. dollar index has strengthened due to strong U.S.
economic data, causing capital to flow back to the U.S. from risk assets like
cryptocurrencies.

● Geopolitical risks cannot be ignored either. The escalation of U.S.-China
trade tensions and other uncertainties have heightened the market's risk-
averse sentiment, leading investors to prefer holding cash and other safe
assets.

**2\. Micro Reasons: Whale Sell-off and Leverage Liquidation**

Within the market, the demonstration effect of whales and the chain reaction
of high leverage positions have formed a vicious cycle.

● In addition to the aforementioned collective actions of long-term holders,
high-leverage trading has acted as an 'accelerator' during the decline.
According to data from on-chain monitoring platforms like Lookonchain, several
whale addresses known for their 'high win rates' have incurred massive
unrealized losses in recent trades.

● For example, a whale at address '0xc2a3...' was liquidated due to a 40x
leverage long position, resulting in a loss of $6.3 million. This chain
liquidation intensified market selling pressure, forming a 'down - liquidation
- further down' death spiral.

**Three. Historical Patterns: Is the Cycle Being Rewritten?**

The cryptocurrency market has long been described as having a 'four-year
cycle', but this cycle appears particularly complex due to its structural
changes.

Source: AiCoin compilation

**1\. Lessons from Historical Cycles**

Looking back at history, each cycle has its unique driving factors and ending
reasons.

● The 2013-2016 cycle was sparked by the Cyprus crisis, then collapsed due to
the bankruptcy of Mt.Gox exchange;

● The 2016-2019 cycle was driven to its peak by the ICO frenzy, and then
entered a bear market due to regulatory crackdowns;

● The 2019-2022 cycle reached an all-time high against the backdrop of global
central banks' 'massive monetary easing', and then plummeted due to the
Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes and the LUNA/FTX crash.

**2\. The Fundamental Difference in This Cycle**

**The core difference in this cycle is that institutions have become one of
the dominant forces through ETFs. The entry of traditional financial giants
like BlackRock and Fidelity has changed the previously retail-driven and
halving narrative model.**

● Jacob Smyth, managing partner of crypto fund APE Capital, stated: 'We are
witnessing a fundamental shift in market structure. The traditional 'four-year
cycle' script may have been rewritten, with Bitcoin transitioning from a
fringe asset to a mainstream allocation asset.'

**Four. Bottom Exploration: Four Major Signals of Market Bottoming**

While the absolute bottom cannot be predicted, we can assess whether the
market has entered a bottoming area through the following dimensions.

**1\. Macroeconomic liquidity has reached a 'policy bottom'**

● Closely monitor the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. Key signals
include: the Federal Reserve officially stopping balance sheet reduction (QT),
and the U.S. government resuming fiscal spending after ending the shutdown.
These will be the most direct catalysts for market rebound. Currently, the
Federal Reserve's balance sheet reduction has significantly slowed, and the
size of the balance sheet has dropped to the edge of the target range. Any
dovish turn could become an opportunity for market rebound.

**2\. On-chain Fundamentals: Stablecoin Supply as a Leading Indicator**

● History shows that when the supply of major stablecoins (such as USDT and
USDC) resumes stable growth, it indicates that the market has sufficient
'ammunition' ready to enter. Data from on-chain analysis firm CryptoQuant
shows that despite the market decline, the supply of stablecoins is still on
an upward trend. This is a glimmer of hope for the market's resilience.

**3\. Market sentiment reaches 'extreme fear'**

● When the 'Fear and Greed Index' remains in the 'extreme fear' range, and
discussions about the 'end of the bull market' become mainstream in media and
communities, it often indicates that market sentiment has become overly
pessimistic, and the bottom is brewing.

**4\. Selling pressure from long-term holders is easing**

● When on-chain data shows that the sell-off speed of LTH has significantly
slowed or even stopped, and accumulation begins again, it will be a strong
positive signal. Currently, selling continues but at a slower pace, and
observation is needed.

**Five. Market Perspectives and Future Outlook**

● Li Ming, chief strategist of Quantum Capital, believes: 'This is not the end
of a cycle, but a transition of cycles. The transfer of LTH to ETFs is a
process of solidifying market fundamentals. Once macro pressures ease, a new
round of increases driven by compliant funds will be healthier.'

● On-chain research institution ByteTree analyst Sarah Chen stated: 'Data
shows that despite the price drop, stablecoin supply is still slowly
increasing, indicating that off-market funds have not completely exited but
are waiting for the right opportunity. The real risk lies in unexpected
tightening at the macro level.'

● Anonymous whale observer WhaleWatcher warned: 'That whale that sold 80,000
BTC is just the beginning. I've detected slight tentative movements from
multiple 'ancient addresses' recently. If they act collectively, the market
bottom may be deeper than expected.'

● Current overall market sentiment is shifting from wait-and-see to panic,
with investors generally worried about macro uncertainties and potential
further sell-offs by whales, and the FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) sentiment has
disappeared.

● For investors, at this stage, it is more important to closely monitor the
evolution of the aforementioned key signals and manage risks than to predict
prices. History tells us that every large-scale transfer of chips often lays a
solid foundation for the next bull market — only this time, the ones picking
up the pieces are no longer retail investors, but BlackRock and Fidelity.

![](https://public.bnbstatic.com/image/pgc/202511/1a92be45b139ddfd855f2c57016c5cbb.png)**The
sell-off of 400,000 Bitcoins is a growing pain in the market's maturation
process, clearly revealing the restructuring of the market's internal
structure under macro headwinds. The bottom is a region, not a point; its
formation requires a resonance of macro liquidity, on-chain fundamentals, and
market sentiment.**

随着香港进入十一月的第二个工作日，比特币的交易价格在约106,500美元附近波动。这一全球最大的数字资产在经历了近一个月内近13%的下跌后保持稳定。以太坊的交易价格在约3,620美元附近，同期内仍下跌了近20%。

本周交易台之间的讨论焦点集中在推动加密货币疲软的原因上：宏观因素还是微观因素。

总部位于新加坡的做市商 Enflux 在给 CoinDesk
的一份报告中表示，“今天的真正故事是轮动”，资金从加密货币市场流出，重新流入由人工智能和金融科技引领的股票市场。

该公司在其报告中表示：“华尔街正准备迎来新一轮上涨，动力来自流动性和基础设施的押注，而加密货币则继续测试其真正的底部位置。”

QCP 资本[采取了不同的观点](https://www.qcpgroup.com/insights/asia-colour-169/)
在其每日更新中表示，近期的回调与宏观因素关系不大。

相反，QCP 表示，比特币的传统持有者，也就是“老玩家”，在经过一轮长时间的上涨后开始获利了结，将大量比特币转移至如 Kraken
等交易所。链上数据显示，过去一个月约有 405,000 枚长期持有的比特币被转出，但价格仍然保持在 100,000 美元以上。

“市场已吸收传统供应且未跌破关键支撑，”QCP 表示，并指出杠杆水平依然较低，资金费率保持平稳。

尽管解释各异，双方一致认为加密市场的整合阶段尚未结束。

市场正处于早期持有者获利了结与风险资本向传统资产广泛转移之间的博弈之中。目前，比特币持续维持在10万美元以上的能力表明其具备结构性韧性，尽管其在与推动全球股票流动性叙事的竞争中面临挑战。

## **市场动向**

**比特币（BTC）：** 比特币在亚洲交易时段下跌至约106,500美元，延续了近期的下行趋势，因长期持有者的抛售超过了更广泛风险资产的温和反弹。

**以太坊：** 以太坊价格徘徊在3,620美元附近，表现逊于比特币，因交易者在去中心化金融活动减弱和风险偏好疲软的背景下，持续削减对山寨币的敞口。

**黄金：**
周一，黄金价格稳定在每盎司4000美元以上，上涨0.6%。交易员们正在权衡中国取消长期黄金税收退税政策的影响，该政策可能抑制本地需求，但通过收紧供应并提高市场整体的替代成本，推动全球价格上升。

  * **多头需要强劲的宏观利好因素——例如通胀下降或纳斯达克指数反弹——来扭转市场情绪，否则空头会将比特币价格推低至 10 万美元以下。**

上周发生的事情并不像人们想象的那样。比特币交易员们曾寄予厚望。事实上，开局确实不错——本周初强劲的上涨势头突破阻力位，令多头兴奋不已——但这种乐观情绪并未持续太久。到了周四，市场将所有涨幅回吐，一路下滑至本周低点。美联储如预期般降息25个基点，但主席鲍威尔书店谨慎的语气立刻扼杀了多头寄予厚望的“未来还会有更多降价”的说法。到周日收盘时，**比特币结算价接近
110,591 美元** —不是确实可以说是灾难性的，但也远不足以提振信心。

### 支撑位面临压力：106,900 美元可能无法永远守住

目前的关键水平是**106,900 美元** 这一点已经在……两次得到证实**0.146 斐波那契回撤**
上周它给交易员带来了一小波反弹，但随着测试次数的增加，较弱情况就是这样。如果这个价位被彻底突破，事态可能会迅速恶化。接下来的几个阶段很可能在……附近。**104,000
美元** 而在此之下，则是更深的下降。**96,000美元**
似乎不可避免。损失10万美元可能会严重动摇市场情绪，尤其是在成交量下降、市场动能转变的情况下。

对牛市来说，问题在于每失败的上涨行情不断在图表上构建新的阻力区。价格收于下方。**21日均线** 目前徘徊在附近**111,000 美元**
而且，那也正是……**要点控制（POC）**比特币价格目前处于停滞状态。这意味着市场最活跃的价格水平现在起到了限制作用。如果比特币能够重新夺回并收于该水平之上，那么比特币的价格走势将难以逆转。**111,000
美元** 还有奔跑的空间**114,600 美元** 或许**122,000 美元** 之后情况就会有所不同。但在突破这些价位之前，空头仍占据优势。

### 本周展望：崩溃风险加剧

进入本周，多头的形势并不乐观。市场动能明显转变，除非出现强劲的买盘涌现，**比特币面临风险滑倒低于 106,900
美元**一旦突破该水平，交易员们就会密切关注。**104,000 美元**
对于反应而言——尽管它已经过两次测试，这意味着这方面的支撑可能并不牢固。如果这方面也出现问题，**96,000美元** 成为下一个合乎逻辑的磁体。

日线图倾斜幅度很大。看跌周一早盘价格走势已显示比特币正向关键的下行区域迈进。多头可能需要宏观催化剂——例如通胀数据走软或股市乐观情绪重燃——才能扭转颓势。否则，市场似乎已准备好迎接新一轮下跌。

### 宏观因素：纳斯达克指数、消费者物价指数及更广阔的图景

短期内，比特币的命运或许更多地取决于传统市场，而非加密货币相关的新闻。**纳斯达克近期的疲软表现**
这对风险资产毫无帮助。如果科技股持续下跌，比特币上涨的可能性将大大降低。持续弹跳力变得更弱了。

交易员们将密切关注**11月13日CPI报告**
他们希望通胀数据降温幅度足够大，从而重燃市场对美联储12月再次降息的预期。这正是多头迫切需要的催化剂。否则，市场格局依然不变：空头占据主导地位，每一次反弹失败只会加剧空头的压力。

标题: 币圈又崩了！以太坊惨跌9%，400亿美元巨鲸“逃离”<b>比特币</b>——谁在接盘？ - FX168财经
真实链接: https://www.fx168news.com/article/%E6%AF%94%E7%89%B9%E5%B8%81-961977
正文: **[FX168财经](https://www.fx168news.com/)报社(北美)讯**
全球[加密货币](https://www.fx168news.com/info/001008)市场近日再度经历剧烈震荡，总市值从4.28万亿美元骤降至3.5万亿美元，短短数日跌幅高达19%。尽管回调迅猛，分析人士认为，11月仍有望迎来阶段性反弹。历史数据显示，[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)在11月的平均涨幅超过40%，或成为市场止跌企稳的重要参考。

### **巨鲸异动引发市场恐慌**

市场情绪持续承压，主要受“巨鲸”资金集中转移影响。**近期有数十亿美元的比特币从冷钱包流向交易所，此举通常被视为大规模抛售前的信号。**
供应端突增令市场恐慌蔓延，而亚洲交易时段的低流动性更放大了波动性。

与此同时，衍生品市场也在剧烈震荡。**据CoinGlass数据，仅周一(11月3日)一天内，全网[加密资产](https://www.fx168news.com/info/001008/)的杠杆仓位爆仓规模超过10亿美元，显示市场流动性正在急剧收缩。**

### **[美联储](https://www.fx168news.com/info/001007/001007002)言论与宏观风险叠加**

美联储最新表态再度加剧了抛压。尽管美联储宣布进行第二次降息，并计划于12月结束量化紧缩（QT），但主席鲍威尔同时警告称通胀问题“仍未得到完全控制”。受此影响，[美元指数](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/DINIW)反弹至100附近，对比特币、[以太坊](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINETH)等高风险资产形成明显压力。

宏观层面上，美国总统特朗普10月中旬宣布对中国稀土出口限制实施“重大关税”，引发投资者短暂恐慌，资金自加密资产流向黄金等避险品种。尽管其随后收回言论，但市场连锁反应已触发高杠杆头寸的集中清算，成为10月市场暴跌的导火索。

Bitwise高级投资策略师Juan
Leon指出：“这些事件让投资者进入了一个高度不确定的十一月。宏观波动加剧之下，10月的急跌更像是一场‘健康的去杠杆过程’，为市场清理了过度投机的泡沫。”

### **[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)或先行探底后反弹**

**截至发稿，比特币（BTC）报105,500美元，24小时跌幅约4%，周跌幅达8%。**
这意味着比特币已从110,000美元上方跌破关键支撑，正测试10.66万美元区域。若该区间失守，下方或将延伸至9.8万至10万美元区间。分析人士指出，该区域或成为新的买入带，一旦市场企稳，有望迎来技术性反弹。

（[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)1小时走势图，来源：FX168）

**根据Coinglass的数据，周一，加密市场的319433个头寸在24小时内平仓超过12亿美元，其中超过11亿美元遭平仓的是多头，而平仓的空头只有1.155亿美元。**

**大额平仓事件发生前，比特币和以太坊出现闪崩，分别在一小时内从108000美元降至105,000美元和3700美元降至3500美元。在同一小时内，这两项资产的平仓总额均超过1亿美元。**

美国投资者可能是这次下跌的先锋，因为Coinbase比特币溢价指数在暴跌期间徘徊在- 30美元左右。整个周末，该指数基本上是负的，周五一度达到- 80美元。

**资金面上，[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)主导率（Bitcoin
Dominance）持续上升，显示资金正从山寨币回流至比特币。**短期虽仍显疲弱，但**技术指标如RSI与布林带均暗示市场正处于压缩阶段，或为下一轮大幅波动的前奏。**

FundStrat联合创始人兼Bitmine董事长Tom
Lee依旧维持乐观预期，他在CNBC节目中表示：“比特币年内仍可能冲击20万美元，以太坊或在2026年前重回7000美元。”不过，他亦承认，“当前阶段，基本面正主导价格走势，市场需要时间完成整理。”

### **[以太坊](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINETH)遭黑客冲击 跌势更急**

以太坊（ETH）跌幅明显高于[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)。**周一盘中一度暴跌9%，跌破关键支撑位3600美元，日内跌幅收窄至约6.7%，现报3,598.99美元，较8月22日高点4885美元已回落近25%。**

（以太坊1小时走势图，来源：FX168）

**此次下挫与黑客事件密切相关。DeFi协议Balancer于周一遭遇严重安全漏洞，损失或超过1亿美元。**
这是近期多起链上攻击事件之一，进一步削弱了市场信心。

分析师指出，[以太坊](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINETH)或仍有20%-25%的下跌空间，目标区间在2750美元附近。即便出现44%的整体回调，长期多头结构依然完好。Lee旗下的Bitmine
Immersion（BMNR）为以太坊最大机构持有者之一，其股价周一亦下跌7.5%。

### **部分山寨币展现相对韧性**

在主流币承压背景下，个别山寨币表现相对稳健。**[币安币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBNB)（BNB）报991.10美元，跌幅约8%，整体回撤有限；Solana（[SOL](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINSOL)）报165.83美元，在150-165美元支撑区间震荡整理。DOGE报0.1678美元，ADA报0.5517美元，跌幅均在8%-10%。**

分析人士认为，若全球流动性改善、美元指数回落，资金将率先回流比特币，随后再流入具备基本面支撑的优质山寨币。

### **40万枚比特币抛售引发“谁在接盘”疑问**

**过去一个月，长期持有者已出售近40万枚[比特币](https://www.fx168news.com/quote/BINBTC)，总价值超过400亿美元。然而，比特币现货ETF同期净流入仅约25亿美元，意味着仍有超过300亿美元的抛售资金去向不明，引发市场对“接盘方”的广泛讨论。**

这种资金分布的不确定性让市场联想到此前的结构性调整阶段——例如在“未平仓量清洗”后，比特币曾录得75%的强劲反弹周期。随着新增供应被市场逐步吸收，机构与散户行为模式的演变仍将是未来走势的关键观察点。

## Cipher Mining的55亿美元AWS租赁推动AI托管扩展

比特币开采商和HPC提供商Cipher Mining
Inc.（纳斯达克：[CIFR](https://bitcoinminingstock.io/company/cifr)）周一发布了其2025年第三季度业务更新，报告收入为7200万美元，非GAAP调整后的收入为4100万美元。

[bn_top_ad]

该公司的亮点发展是一项与Amazon Web Services (AWS)
签署的价值55亿美元的15年租约，用于提供专门用于[AI](https://news.bitcoin.com/study-generative-ai-
could-add-trillions-to-global-economy/)应用的交钥匙数据中心空间和电力。

根据租约条款，Cipher
表示将在2026年提供300兆瓦的容量，并配备空气和液体冷却系统。该项目将分两个阶段展开，始于2026年7月，并于2026年第四季度完成，租金将于2026年8月开始。这笔交易公告指出，Cipher进一步涉足高性能计算
(HPC) 托管服务，而不仅仅是[比特币开采](https://news.bitcoin.com/canaans-4-5-mw-bitcoin-
mining-servers-aim-to-stabilize-japans-power-grid/)。

Cipher的首席执行官Tyler Page将[这个季度](https://news.bitcoin.com/cipher-mining-

## 比特币下跌，交易员担忧美国纽约市长Mamdani可能胜选

根据Polymarket的预测，民主社会主义者Zohran
Mamdani很有可能成为纽约市的下一任市长，而比特币交易员对此似乎并不太满意。这位34岁的乌干达出生的纽约人承诺提高税收和实行30美元的最低工资，这些政策被视为对企业和富人的不利之举。比特币在夜间开始下跌，降至105,000美元，然后在现实中几乎保证Mamdani胜选的情况下回升至107,000美元。

Polymarket)

Mamdani在2025年6月崛起，在民主党初选中击败了深受喜爱的纽约州前州长Andrew
Cuomo。Cuomo是一位经验丰富的政治家和律师，在2021年因性骚扰指控丑闻辞去州长职务后，试图东山再起。尽管他在初选中失利，这位现年67岁的皇后区本地人决定以独立候选人的身份与Mamdani对抗。

但根据预测市场如Polymarket和Kalshi，Cuomo的形势并不好。两者都显示Mamdani有显著的领先优势，除非出现政治奇迹，否则这位年轻的社会主义穆斯林和嘻哈艺术家可能在周二大选日再度失败Cuomo。

[bn_top_ad]

Mamdani承诺进行社会主义风格的改革，如政府拥有的杂货店、冻结租金，甚至是免费公共交通。所有这些都发生在掌控全球资本主义基础的城市中。目前尚不清楚Mamdani是否会执行他的社会主义政策，但市场可能将他的胜利视作企业界的损失，这可能部分解释了今天比特币的价格走势。

“我认为我们不应该有亿万富翁，”Mamdani在接受NBC采访时说道。“因为坦白说，在如此不平等的时刻，这是太多的钱，我们最终需要的是在我们的城市、州和国家实现更多的平等。”

**市场指标概览**

根据Coinmarketcap的数据，比特币在报道时的交易价格为106,963.59美元，24小时内下跌2.87%，自上周以来下跌7.01%。加密货币的价格范围自昨天以来在105,336.36美元和110,764.92美元之间波动。

24小时交易量明显上涨104.22%至682.4亿美元，即使估计的周末后激增也很重要。但大幅增长似乎主要是由于周日交易量异常低所致。随着价格的下降，比特币的总市值下降至2.13万亿美元，但比特币的主导地位却激增至60.70%，不寻常地跳升了1.26%。这一大幅变动暗示着山寨币市场正在苦苦挣扎。

/ Trading View)

根据Coinglass的数据，比特币期货未平仓合约的总价值下降0.48%至700.2亿美元。清算金额攀升至总计3.159亿美元，主要由295.34万美元的多头投资者损失主导，这些投资者对当前价格下跌措手不及。剩余的清算来自过度激进的空头卖家，他们在清算保证金中损失了1,756万美元。

## 常见问题 ⚡

  * **为什么比特币跌至107,000美元以下？**  
交易员对Polymarket预测Zohran Mamdani胜选的93%几率作出反应，将其社会主义议程视为不利于市场。

  * **Zohran Mamdani是谁？**  
一位来自曼哈顿的34岁乌干达裔民主社会主义者，他正在竞选纽约市市长，主张提高税收、冻结租金和免费公共交通。

  * **预测市场如何定位？**  
Polymarket和Kalshi都显示Mamdani对独立挑战者Andrew Cuomo有决定性领先。

  * **这对投资者意味着什么？**  
Mamdani的胜选可能会在短期内引发对与纽约经济相关的加密和金融领域的风险规避。

近期[加密货币](https://cryptonews.com/cn/cryptocurrency/best-crypto-to-
buy/)资产价格走势波动，投资者持观望态度，分析对后市走势也转趋观望，全球交易量排名第二的加密货币交易所Bybit发布最新一期的市场洞察报告指，由于12月政策走向仍不明朗，传统与数字市场皆处于观望状态，等待更具决定性的经济信号出现。

报告指出，虽然风险资产初期欢迎降息决定，但鲍威尔的谨慎言论削弱了市场乐观情绪。美债殖利率在短暂下跌后回升，股市涨势趋缓，投资人重新评估未来政策预期。

相比之下，数字资产出现短暂的「舒缓性反弹」，比特币与以太币一度延续涨势，随后回到整理格局。尽管宏观环境支撑风险偏好，但加密市场反应温和，显示市场结构正逐步成熟，期权市场亦反映出持续谨慎的预期。

## 主要加密货币表现波动

  
事实上，比特币（BTC）、以太币（ETH）、瑞波币（XRP）等主要加密货币于本周五早段续跌，其中比特币仍在11万美元水平上落，比特币本月累计仍要下跌，今年以来仍上涨约18%。

Bybit
认为，加密资产对流动性变化敏感度高，同时受到内部市场动态的驱动。但由于12月政策走向仍不明朗，传统与数字市场皆处于观望状态，等待更具决定性的经济信号出现。  

## Bitget COO：未来数周市场仍保持高度敏感

Barron 引述另一交易所bitget营运长 Vugar Usi Zade
指出，近期市场情绪转趋谨慎，反映出宏观经济不确定性升高。他表示：「通膨持续、高利率环境以及联准会政策路径的不确定性，使投资人明显转向保守。」他预期，市场在未来数周将对宏观数据变化保持高度敏感。

若后续经济数据支持进一步宽松，市场普遍预期比特币等风险资产可能出现明显反弹。然而，美国政府停摆导致部分关键数据延迟发布，也令市场缺乏方向。由于加密货币通常受益于借贷成本下降，利率走向仍是影响资金流动的核心因素。

## 市场动荡：AI恐慌和社会主义者的纽约市使比特币和股票动摇

“跌破10万似乎是不可避免的，”渣打银行的Geoffrey Kendrick几天前说道。“这可能是比特币最后一次低于10万。”
作为该银行数字资产研究团队的负责人，Kendrick在周二比特币下跌6%至99.9K后再次回升至101K以上时，可能对他的预测感到证实。

[bn_top_ad]

由许多人所称的AI泡沫引发的看跌情绪导致股市下滑。在报告时，标准普尔500指数、纳斯达克和道琼斯分别下跌了0.91%、1.49%和0.43%。AI公司Palantir（纳斯达克：PLTR）领跌，尽管超过Q3营收预期，但股价下跌了7%。罪魁祸首：高达623.50的市盈率，换句话说，投资者愿意为Palantir创造的每一美元支付623.50美元。与芯片制造商英伟达的市盈率53.81相比，市场称Palantir“估值过高”就显而易见了。像Michael
Burry这样的交易员甚至更进一步，做空Palantir和英伟达。

“他其实是在做空AI。……是我们和英伟达，”Palantir
CEO亚历克斯·卡普在一次CNBC[采访](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/04/karp-big-short-burry-
palantir-nvidia.html)中批评Burry时表示。“认为芯片和本体论是你想要做空的东西，这太疯狂了。”

Mamdani可能今晚当选为纽约市市长。他代表了一个可能部分解释周二市场动荡的因素。）

但还有另一个较少被谈论的催化剂可能在打压市场：纽约市市长候选人Zohran
Mamdani。这位34岁的自称“民主社会主义者”今晚可能赢得市长选举。问题是，当一位社会主义市长被选为世界金融之都的领导者时，市场会如何表现？对大多数经济学家而言，答案可能是令人沮丧的，也许这种普遍的风险偏好减少情绪至少在短期内加剧了比特币的问题。然而，如果考虑长期观点，押注比特币或AI可能不是最明智的策略。

**市场指标概览**

根据Coinmarketcap的数据，比特币在报告时的价格为101,138.07美元，过去24小时内下跌了5.47%。自上周以来，该数字资产已下跌近12%，自周一下午起波动于99,990.79美元至107,363.16美元之间。

标题: <b>比特币</b>崩跌失守10万美元！13亿美元爆仓，2018年噩梦是否再现？ - 凤凰网财经
真实链接: https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8o1Me1nbIeb
正文: FX168财经报社(北美)讯
周二（11月5日），**比特币（BTC）延续下跌势头，一度跌破10万美元大关，较年内高点回落逾17%。主要加密货币全线下挫，包括Aster、Aptos和Toncoin在内的多种山寨币单日跌幅超过10%，自2025年高点累计跌幅超40%，集体陷入技术性熊市。**
分析人士指出，本轮抛售的主导力量来自宏观层面，而非单纯的市场技术修正。

**比特币周二盘中再度大幅下挫，日内跌幅约6%，盘中一度跌至99,966美元。这是自6月23日以来，比特币首次跌破10万美元关口。以市值计全球第二大加密货币以太坊当日下跌近10%，报3,296美元。**

（比特币1小时走势图，来源：FX168）

Compass Point分析师Ed Engel表示，当前散户投资者在下跌阶段的“逢低买入”热情明显不及以往。“虽然长期持有者（Long-term
Holders）的抛售在牛市中并不罕见，但本轮周期中散户现货买家的参与度明显较低。” 他在研报中指出。

Engel认为，近期的回调可能令比特币进一步跌入下行区间。“由于长期持有者仍在卖出，一旦短线持有者（Short-term
Holders）进一步投降，市场将面临更大的下行风险。”

他补充道：“我们认为比特币在9.5万美元上方存在支撑，但短期内缺乏明显的反弹催化因素。”

**Engel指出，过去几周，比特币价格整体呈下降趋势，而今年10月并未延续往年传统的“季节性上涨”规律。上一次比特币在10月失去季节性支撑是在2018年，随后在11月暴跌37%。**

**宏观主导市场：美联储转向犹疑、美元走强压制风险资产**

**本周以来，全球风险资产普遍承压，从科技股高估值回调到美联储政策前景不确定性，投资者风险偏好明显降温。**

比特币在美联储10月会议结束后遭遇新一轮抛售，当时主席鲍威尔（Jerome
Powell）明确表示12月是否继续降息“尚未确定”，这一表态迅速削弱了市场对宽松周期的押注。

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEXy8vJkA4prAAAACklEQVQI12NgAAAAAgAB4iG8MwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

美元指数（DXY）随即走强，周二升至99.80，创下8月初以来新高。**历史数据显示，美元与比特币通常呈负相关关系——美元走强往往压制加密资产表现。**

美联储理事Austan Goolsbee表示： “我对通胀的担忧依然存在——通胀已连续四年半高于目标，并且目前仍朝错误的方向发展。”

分析师指出，美联储或在12月暂停降息，这种政策不确定性叠加美元走强，正在成为加密市场新的系统性压力源。

**恐慌蔓延与流动性收缩：13亿美元爆仓引发市场共振**

随着市场风险偏好恶化，投资者恐慌情绪迅速攀升。**加密恐惧与贪婪指数（Crypto Fear & Greed Index）
跌至21，重新进入“极度恐惧”区间。**

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEXy8vJkA4prAAAACklEQVQI12NgAAAAAgAB4iG8MwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

（图源：Zerohedge）

**过去24小时内，加密市场爆仓金额飙升160%至13亿美元，涉及32.7万名交易者，创近数月新高。**

分析人士认为，**这场连锁爆仓的成因与10月初离岸衍生品市场的抛售如出一辙。**

Codex分析师Li表示：“10月初的连环清算为本月定下了基调，但如今真正主导市场的，是宏观情绪。”

The ABC Squared 管理合伙人Marcus
Sturdivant则指出：“当股市与比特币同步下跌时，不少投资者选择卖出比特币以平衡股票头寸，从而形成了交叉压力。”

**投资信心降温：年末目标受质疑，机构资金流出现**

市场对比特币年末走势的乐观预期正明显降温。包括Fundstrat联合创始人Tom Lee与汇丰银行（HSBC）策略师Geoff
Kendrick在内的多位多头人士，仍预测比特币年底将触及20万美元，但这意味着币价需在不到两个月内上涨近95%。

区块链分析公司 **Blockpliance创始人Guillermo Fernandes**
指出：“在贸易前景趋紧、利率走向不明、以及政府停摆导致经济数据中断的背景下，投资者已无法像之前那样，在12万美元区间自信加仓。”

**ETF资金流数据显示，机构投资者情绪也出现降温。第四季度前两周录得超过50亿美元净流入，但近四周已出现累计15亿美元净流出。**

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEXy8vJkA4prAAAACklEQVQI12NgAAAAAgAB4iG8MwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

**其中，iShares Bitcoin Trust（IBIT） 单周流出达4.03亿美元，Grayscale GBTC流出6800万美元。**

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEXy8vJkA4prAAAACklEQVQI12NgAAAAAgAB4iG8MwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

(图源：彭博社，Bitwise Europe)

**全球加密ETP产品上周合计净流出2.46亿美元，其中比特币相关资金外流7.52亿美元。**

不过，**年内累计资金仍保持正流入** ，显示机构长期配置意愿尚未逆转。

**链上与流动性指标：积累仍在，但买盘动能趋弱**

链上数据显示，卖方压力环比下降（835百万美元 → 469百万美元），交易所持有的BTC储备降至285万枚，表明市场总体仍处于净流出、净积累阶段。

鲸鱼账户在过去一周仅向交易所转入约4900枚BTC，显示机构投资者正进行结构性调整而非恐慌性抛售。

与此同时，CryptoQuant数据显示，稳定币供应比（SSR） 已回落至13–14区间，这一水平与年初比特币反弹前相似。

![](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEXy8vJkA4prAAAACklEQVQI12NgAAAAAgAB4iG8MwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)

（图源：CryptoQuant）

低SSR通常意味着场外资金储备增加，潜在买盘力量正在积聚。

但分析人士提醒，本轮周期中SSR反弹强度较此前明显减弱，市场流动性动能或正在放缓。

**技术面偏空：关键支撑在10万美元，形态预示下行延续**

从技术角度看，比特币已连续发出多重看跌信号。**在日线图上，BTC形成头肩顶（Head-and-
Shoulders）结构，并出现“死亡交叉”——50日均线下穿200日均线。**

价格跌破上升通道下轨，并运行在Ichimoku云图与Supertrend指标下方，显示空头力量占优。

分析师普遍将10万美元整数关口视为短期关键支撑。一旦跌破，市场或进入加速下行阶段，山寨币跌势可能进一步扩大。若守稳该水平，则有望在稳定币流动性恢复的推动下，迎来情绪性反弹。

**结语：宏观主导下的风险再定价，市场进入高波动期**

Ecoinometrics认为，本轮比特币下跌“更多源自情绪与宏观不确定性，而非结构性恶化”：“从宏观层面看，金融条件依旧宽松，股市仍处历史高位，比特币已被短期恐慌低估。”

目前市场正处于“宏观主导、流动性分化”的阶段。

美元强势、美联储谨慎、风险资产普遍回调——这一组合或意味着比特币短期仍将在高波动区间震荡。

投资者将继续关注**美联储12月会议、美元走势与市场流动性信号** ，以判断加密市场的下一步方向。

标题: <b>Bitcoin</b> Plunges Below $100K for First Time Since June as Crypto Correction Worsens - 富途资讯
真实链接: https://news.futunn.com/post/64368592/bitcoin-plunges-below-100k-for-first-time-since-june-as
正文: Bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $100,000 level on Tuesday on at least some major
exchanges — Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken, to name three — its weakest price
since late June in a broader crypto market correction. The move below that
price was met with at least a bit of buying, though, with BTC bouncing back to
$101,300 within minutes.

比特币（BTC）在周二跌破了10万美元大关，至少在一些主要交易所——Coinbase、Gemini 和
Kraken——是如此，这是自六月底以来的最低价格，在更广泛的加密市场调整中。不过，跌破该价位时至少出现了一些买盘，BTC在几分钟内反弹至101,300美元。

The largest cryptocurrency now has declined more than 20% from its record high
above $126,000, hit just one month ago. It also made a new low below the
crypto flash crash on October 10, which ranked as possibly the largest
liquidation events in crypto history, taking BTC to $103,000 from above
$120,000 in less than a day.

这一最大的加密货币现已较其一个月前创下的超过12.6万美元的历史高点下跌了20%以上。它还打破了10月10日加密闪崩时的低点，这次闪崩可能是加密历史上最大的清算事件之一，BTC在不到一天的时间里从超过12万美元跌至10.3万美元。

In the following weeks, recovery attempts fizzled out as bounces above
$110,000 met with quick selloffs.

在接下来的几周里，随着反弹至11万美元以上遭遇快速抛售，复苏尝试失败了。

Among the more recent catalysts for the selling is the Federal Reserve's
surprise hawkish surprise last week, with Jerome Powell and a growing number
of his cohorts cooling expectations for another interest rate cut in December.

在最近引发抛售的催化剂中，包括美联储上周意外的鹰派立场，杰罗姆·鲍威尔和越来越多的同僚们降低了对12月再次降息的预期。

正文: 比特币（BTC）周二在至少一些主要交易所——包括Coinbase、Gemini和Kraken——跌破10万美元关口，创下自六月底以来的最低价，反映出更广泛的加密市场调整。然而，跌破该价格水平后，市场出现了一定程度的买盘，BTC在数分钟内回升至101,300美元。

目前最大的加密货币自一个月前创下超过126,000美元的历史高点以来，已下跌超过20%。其价格也创下了新低，跌破了10月10日的加密货币闪电崩盘低点。该事件被认为是加密史上可能最大的清算事件之一，使比特币价格在不到一天时间内从12万美元以上跌至103,000美元以下。

在接下来的几周内，随着价格反弹至 110,000 美元以上后迅速遭遇抛售，复苏企图逐渐失效。

近期抛售的原因之一是联邦储备委员会上周的意外鹰派立场，杰罗姆·鲍威尔及其越来越多的同僚降低了市场对今年十二月再次降息的预期。

近期比特币价格的挣扎对于多头而言尤为令人沮丧，因为这段时间正值股票市场持续刷新纪录的反弹，以及黄金市场——直到最近——的强劲表现。然而，今日值得关注的是，市场资产普遍出现抛售，纳斯达克指数下跌2%，黄金下跌1.6%。

上涨时不相关，下跌时完全相关。对比特币来说，这是一个艰难的秋天。

### 比特币的下一步走向

加密交易公司Wincent的董事保罗·霍华德表示，夏季ETF投资者和数字资产金库（DATs）的强劲需求已逐渐消退，取而代之的是长期钱包开始抛售其持有资产。

"共识显示，我们可能正处于有望成为熊市的阶段，这与比特币备受推崇的四年周期相符，"
他说道。尽管如此，他指出，如果比特币能保持在100,000美元以上，市场可能避免大规模的恐慌性抛售和更深层次的清算。"

资产管理公司 Hashdex 全球市场洞察负责人 Gary O’Shea
引述了多重宏观压力——包括美联储今年可能不降息、关税问题、信贷市场以及股市估值等因素——作为当前市场下行的驱动因素。尽管如此，他强调长期前景依然乐观。

"他表示：“我们不认为今日的价格走势表明比特币长期投资案例的弱化。”随着机构采用加速，奥谢亚认为比特币在未来几个月仍有可能攀升至新的历史高点。

![play](/images/uploads/ListenArticleHeadphone.svg) Listen to article

## 采宽出售比特币

根据采宽（NYSE: [SQNS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-
SQNS/)）11月4日的公告，此次出售交易为其7月7日发行的可转换债券的50%赎回提供了资金。这将公司的未偿债务从1.89亿美元减少到9450万美元，同时比特币储备从3234个BTC减少到2264个BTC。根据当前市场价格，采宽的比特币净资产价值（NAV）现约为2.4亿美元，将其债务与净资产比率从55%改善到39%。

首席执行官乔治·卡拉姆强调，尽管出售了比特币，但公司的信念依然坚定。“我们的比特币财务战略和对比特币的深信不疑保持不变，”卡拉姆说道。“这次交易是基于当前市场条件解锁股东价值的战术决策。”

已有传言称，采宽悄悄卸载了一些BTC，因为上周出现了一笔引起关注的链上转移。“哦，这是真的，”[Pledditor](https://x.com/Pledditor/status/1985667917577322672)
在周二调侃道。“哈哈，把公司的弃售称为‘战略资产重新配置’，Pledditor补充道。“所以你基本上是亏本出售了BTC？”一位X用户在采宽的帖子下[反击道](https://x.com/bitferatu/status/1985675781436068071)。“哎呀，你本不该这样做的，”另一位用户[插话道](https://x.com/Denominator21M/status/1985691007816532107)。

在新闻稿中，采宽表示，预期债务减少会推动其美国存托股份（ADS）回购计划，并且为未来的财政措施创造更大灵活性。公司表示，去杠杆化举措消除债务契约限制，拓宽了优化其比特币持有的战略选项。

Pledditor后来指出，他听了采宽的财报电话会议，怀疑可能会出售更多的BTC。“如果他们出售更加多的比特币，比已经抛售得还多，请不要感到惊讶。‘剩余的647个未质押的BTC仍在我们的财政库中，如有需要，以供之前宣布的ADS回购计划使用，’”

采宽甚至可能借鉴Saylor著名的“钻石手”策略。公司还暗示可能的未来措施，包括发行优先股并从其比特币财政中产生收益。采宽还表示，依然专注于有纪律的资本管理和长期股东价值创造。

采宽通信成立于巴黎，是一家专注于物联网（IoT）4G和5G连接的无晶圆厂半导体公司。该公司是最早管理以比特币为中心财库的上市公司之一，使用运营和融资所得积累BTC作为长期储备资产。

标题: <b>比特币</b>、以太坊、索拉纳交易员因价格暴跌5-10%被强制平仓超10亿美元 - CoinDesk
真实链接: https://www.coindesk.com/zh/markets/2025/11/04/bitcoin-ether-solana-traders-liquidated-for-over-usd1b-as-prices-dump-5-10
正文: 比特币周一从112,000美元急剧下跌至106,000美元以下，引发了数周以来最大的一波清算浪潮，抹去了加密市场中超过12.7亿美元的杠杆期货仓位。

来自 CoinGlass 的数据显示，多头交易者占总平仓量近 90%，随着价格从周末高点回落，超过 11.4 亿美元的看涨押注被清算。空头仅占总量中的
1.28 亿美元。

(CoinGlass)

  
当交易者使用借入资金进行交易且其保证金低于要求水平时，强制平仓（清算）便会发生。在加密期货交易所，此过程是自动进行的，当价格大幅逆向运动导致杠杆交易亏损时，平台会将该仓位卖出至公开市场以弥补损失。  

大量的多头平仓集聚可能预示着市场的投降及潜在的短期底部，而大规模的空头爆仓则可能在动量反转前预示局部顶部。交易者还可以关注平仓水平的集中区域，帮助识别可能作为短期支撑或阻力的强制性活动区间。

最大的一笔爆仓发生在HTX，涉及一笔价值3,395万美元的BTC-USDT多头仓位被平仓。

Hyperliquid 在整体活动中领先所有平台，强制平仓金额达到3.74亿美元，其中98%为多头，其次是 Bybit，金额为3.15亿美元，Binance
排第三，为2.5亿美元。

此次抛盘发生在比特币最新一次在113,000美元以上遭遇回调之后，且主要永续合约交易所普遍出现薄弱的订单簿，导致在流动性较低时段的连锁清算加剧了价格波动。

此类事件通常标志着过热市场中的短期“清理时刻”，在此期间杠杆会进行调整，现货买家则逐步重新入场。

尽管未平仓合约量仍维持在约300亿美元附近，且资金费率仅略有下降，交易员似乎对本周晚些时候美联储利率决议前的进一步波动持谨慎态度。

以太坊和索拉纳遭遇类似压力，合计清算金额超过3亿美元，而大多数山寨币在投机需求减退的情况下普遍走低。

标题: <b>比特币</b>跌至6月以来新低避险情绪冲击加密货币 - 富途资讯
真实链接: https://news.futunn.com/post/64365023
正文: 比特币抹去了整个夏季所取得的涨幅，早前华尔街热情拥护和机构大量买入所引发的涨幅遭回吐。

周二纽约时段，比特币一度下跌3.7%至102，870美元，创6月23日以来的最低水平。该价格自一个月前达到的纪录高位已下跌近20%。以太币跌幅一度达3.9%，多种替代币同样出现类似跌幅，使得许多交易不太简便、流动性相对较低的代币今年以来的跌幅达到了50%以上。

转折点出现于10月中旬，当时一波猛烈的平仓潮抹去了数十亿美元的多头头寸。自那以来，交易员一直在场边观望。比特币期货未平仓合约仍远低于溃跌前的水平，即便融资成本有所好转，但愿意重新入场的人依旧寥寥无几。其结果是：比特币今年仅上涨了超过10%，落后于股票，作为投资组合对冲手段的效果依旧差强人意。

![](https://record.futunn.com/news-editor-

error/1/format/webp)“比特币跌至6月低点反应了一种市场结构，也就是仍在努力消化10月那场大规模平仓事件带来的心理阴影，该事件根本性地改变了市场参与人士对待总体市场下行趋势的方式，”专注于去中心化金融的Ergonia研究主管Chris
Newhouse表示。

此外，根据Coinglass汇编的数据，在周二下行期间，只有不到5亿美元的杠杆头寸在期货市场平仓，暗示交易环境清淡。周一约为12亿美元，远低于10月10日创纪录的190亿美元左右。

与此同时，期权交易员对进一步的下跌构建了大量的对冲，据Coinbase旗下加密货币交易所Deribit的数据显示，行权价为8万美元、11月下旬到期的看跌期权合约需求最为旺盛。

标题: 传统钱包推动<b>比特币</b>11月回调 - Bitcoin.com News
真实链接: https://news.bitcoin.com/zh/chuantong-qianbao-tuidong-bitebi-11yue-huitiao/
正文: **由于长期持有者将大笔资金转移到交易所，表明获利了结，比特币在11月初跌破108,000美元。尽管有卖压，但BTC在100,000美元以上的弹性凸显了持续的机构支持和市场稳定性。**

![play](/images/uploads/ListenArticleHeadphone.svg) Listen to article

## 比特币尽管OG获利了结仍保持在100,000美元以上

[比特币](http://bitcoin.com)在11月初承受压力，从亚洲交易时段的110,000美元滑落。下跌似乎是由长时间持有者或 “OG”
转移大量比特币到交易所所驱动，延续了一个月之久的获利了结趋势，这导致BTC自2018年以来的第一个红色十月。

[bn_top_ad]

QCP的最新[市场见解](https://www.qcpgroup.com/insights/asia-
colour-169/)指出，最近的回调缺乏明确的宏观催化剂，传统市场在支持性政策条件下保持稳定。相反，数据显示来自老牌钱包的明显抛售，表明长期持有者在今年早些时候比特币迅速升值后正逐渐重新分配代币。

市场波动性有所上升，衍生品头寸仍然倾向于下行保护。然而，情绪保持稳定：永久合约的未平仓量低迷，融资利率显示出投机过度的迹象，表明自10月10日清算事件以来，杠杆驱动的抛售已大部分被消除。

尽管有卖压，比特币在过去一个月内吸收了大约405,000
[BTC](https://buy.bitcoin.com/btc/)遗留供应，没有突破重要的100,000美元支持位。ETF流出和像Strategy
Inc.和Metaplanet这样的公司的减轻企业积累并没有颠覆机构参与和稳定链上活动的更广泛趋势。

虽然一些交易员猜测周期可能接近顶峰，但其他人认为这一阶段是健康的整合。目前，比特币在遗留抛售中保持稳健的能力凸显出市场的成熟和其不断加深的机构资本基础。

## 常见问题**🔍**

  * **为什么比特币在11月初跌破108,000美元？**  
这一下跌是由于长期持有者在年内强劲收益之后将大量BTC转移到交易所进行获利了结。

  * **机构对回调如何反应？** 尽管有资金外流和较轻的积累，机构支持仍然坚定，帮助比特币保持在100,000美元以上。
  * **市场数据对情绪有什么暗示？** 衍生品和融资利率显示出有限的杠杆和稳定的情绪，表明市场健康整合。
  * **这对比特币的前景意味着什么？** 在未失去关键支持的情况下吸收大量遗留抛售，强调了比特币的成熟和弹性。

标题: 甲骨文信用违约互换飙升，<b>比特币</b>失守10万美元关口前最后支撑位 - 新浪财经
真实链接: https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/usstock/c/2025-11-04/doc-infwfyak9877333.shtml
正文: 受科技股动能减弱影响，比特币（BTC-USD）已跌破一道关键支撑位，而该支撑位此前一直阻止其向 10 万美元关口下滑。

CoinDesk 数据显示，在亚洲交易时段，这一主流加密货币跌破 10.6 万美元，穿透了近几周多次提供支撑的这一水平。

以太坊（Ether）也跌至 8 月以来的最低水平，关键移动平均线出现 “死叉”，表明下行动能正在增强；瑞波币（XRP）则触及三周低点。

10x Research 创始人马库斯・蒂伦在给客户的报告中表示，比特币跌破支撑位后，市场焦点将转向 10 万 - 10.1
万美元区间。他指出，若该区间失守，比特币可能进一步下探至 9.4 万美元附近，甚至可能回调至 8.5 万美元 —— 这一 “最大痛苦区间”
同时也是强劲的链上支撑位所在。

他补充道：“尽管这种走势可能较为极端，但只要比特币保持在当前下行趋势线之上，下行风险就仍在可控范围内。”

比特币价格表现疲软，恰逢美联储快速降息的可能性下降，且美元指数（追踪美元对主要货币汇率的指数）出现看涨逆转迹象。

分析师尼尔・塞西在社交平台 X
上援引[高盛](https://stock.finance.sina.com.cn/usstock/quotes/GS.html)(790.83,

月以来首次倒挂（即看涨期权隐含波动率高于看跌期权）。这种现象仅发生过少数几次，表明投资者普遍押注股价将继续上涨。”

塞西补充道：“从历史上看，此类低风险逆转指标读数往往伴随着乐观情绪达到顶峰后的短期盘整或逆转。”

**[甲骨文](https://stock.finance.sina.com.cn/usstock/quotes/ORCL.html)(248.17,

与此同时，与甲骨文（Oracle）相关的信用违约互换（CDS，用于衡量为应对潜在违约而购买保险的成本）在该公司披露第三季度大规模人工智能投资后大幅飙升，达到除重大宏观压力时期外从未出现过的水平。

部分分析师认为，这一现象反映出投资者对蓬勃发展的人工智能支出感到担忧。自 2023
年以来，对人工智能的乐观预期一直是股市及加密货币等更广泛风险资产牛市的主要驱动力之一。

标题: 24亿美金<b>比特币</b>突然转移！背后真相太扎心… - Binance
真实链接: https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31933526997618
正文: 兄弟们，出大事了！

**Strategy** ——这家美股上市公司，

刚刚悄悄转移了2.27万个比特币，

价值24.5亿美元！

全部是场外操作，没走交易所，

钱去了哪？不知道。

想干啥？没人知道。

但这波操作，时机太微妙了。

就在最近，它的股价撑不住了。

**NAV溢价从208%直接崩到4%** ！

啥意思？

原来股票市场愿意为它“持有比特币”这个概念，

多付两倍的价钱。

现在呢？

**投资者不买账了。**

更狠的是——

**它的股价，已经快低于它手里比特币的账面价值了。**

你算笔账

直接花5万买1个BTC，

还是花5.2万去买一只“宣称持有BTC”的股票？

傻子都知道选哪个。

所以现在，比特币微策略这个玩法，快玩不下去了。

你喊得再响“我们是数字黄金公司”，

人家投资者一句话就怼回来，

那我为什么不直接买黄金？

这不是一家的事。

你看Metaplanet、Semler Scientific这些小兄弟，

股价早就跌破了BTC持仓市值，

结果呢？

只能靠疯狂回购股票、甚至合并公司来撑场面。

Q3财报赚了28亿美金？

市场根本不看。

大家现在只关心一个问题

**你的股票，到底值不值这个价？**

而这次24亿美金的BTC突然转移，

很可能就是一次资产重组的前兆，

要么是去还债，

要么是准备新一轮资本操作，

甚至……

为下一轮牛市提前布子。

但最扎心的现实是

**当信仰退潮，商业模式就得变。**

靠买股票等于买比特币这招躺赚的时代，

**过去了。**

接下来谁能活下来？

不是喊口号喊得响的，

而是真能把资本、资产、股价三者关系理顺的。

别再迷信“代理买比特币”了。

**自己真金白银的买比特币，永远比一张股票票子更硬。**

标题: <b>比特币</b>11月跌势加剧AI估值担忧提振避险偏好 - 富途资讯
真实链接: https://news.futunn.com/post/64358328
正文: 比特币周二成为避险情绪的受害者，随着投资者对人工智能股票估值的可持续性日益担忧，他们抛售了这种加密货币。

比特币最新交易价格为103952美元，日内下跌2.5%，过去两日累计下跌约6%。市值第二大的加密货币以太币周二下跌2.5%，两日跌幅超过10%，报3，503美元。

尽管比特币的避险地位近来有所提升，但这种加密货币吸引了许多与人工智能股票相同的大型投资者，从而在其中一个市场表现不佳时，将两种交易联系了起来。

error/1/format/webp)投资者因担忧Palantir令人瞠目的估值而抛售这家与人工智能相关的公司，尽管其盈利业绩稳健。

Compass Point分析师Ed
Engel也指出，散户投资者可能没有像以往那样大举逢低买入：“虽然长期持有者的抛售是牛市的常见特征，但散户现货买家的参与度一直低于之前的周期。”

随着科技股动能减弱，市场情绪显著转空。

10x Research创始人马库斯·蒂伦（Markus Thielen）在客户报告中指出，比特币当前的技术破位令市场焦点转向10万至10.1万美元区间。

“若该区间失守，价格可能进一步回测至9.4万美元，甚至全面回撤至8.5万美元区域——这一区域既是所谓‘最大痛苦区（maximum pain
zone）’，亦与链上强支撑位吻合。”

蒂伦补充称：“尽管这一走势属于极端情形，但只要比特币仍守在当前下降趋势线之上，整体下行风险仍可控。”

宏观因素施压：美联储降息预期降温 美元走强抑制风险偏好

分析人士指出，比特币疲软部分源于宏观面逆风：美联储快速降息预期下降，同时美元指数（DXY）出现技术性反弹。美元走强令以美元计价的风险资产（包括加密货币与成长型科技股）承压。

自2023年以来，AI投资热潮不仅推动美股和科技股创下历史高位，也带动包括加密货币在内的广泛风险资产上行。但随着AI投资进入饱和期、流动性预期趋紧，市场或正面临“现实检验”（reality
check）——科技与加密资产的高估值区间，可能已进入阶段性调整周期。
